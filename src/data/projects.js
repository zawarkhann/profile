  title: "Pods 3D â€” Immersive Social Media Platform",
  description:
    "An immersive 3D social media platform where every post, profile, and brand lives inside a customizable 3D pod.",
  longDescription:
    "Pods 3D redefines digital interaction by transforming flat social feeds into explorable 3D worlds. Each user or business owns a Pod â€” a personalized 3D space built with PlayCanvas and Three.js â€” where they can showcase posts, portfolios, or products. Visitors can walk around, chat live inside posts, or attend virtual events, all running in the browser with real-time rendering. \n\nThe platform combines a React-powered frontend with a Node.js/Express backend and Redis for real-time data sync, ensuring smooth interactions even in multiplayer environments. Integrated WebRTC enables live voice and video calls directly within pods, while rich media embeds (images, videos, music, YouTube) let creators turn their space into a true digital hub. Pods 3D is more than social media â€” itâ€™s a fully immersive social-commerce experience.",

    longDescription:
      "Pods Live turns any pod into a multiplayer venue. Create a room, invite friends (up to 5 guests), and hang out inside an interactive 3D space. Attendees can move their avatars, talk over low-latency WebRTC audio/video, send live chat messages, react with emotes, and interact with media boards (images, videos, YouTube). A built-in scene editor (PlayCanvas + Three.js) lets hosts place assets, banners and stages on the fly. Real-time presence, messaging and room state are backed by Redis; React powers the UI and Express/Node orchestrates sessions, permissions and signaling. Itâ€™s lightweight, browser-based, and feels like a mini-metaverse meeting.",
